# spring-systems-coding-challenge

Spring Systems Full Stack Challenge
The purpose of this challenge is to test your ability to come up with solutions on your own. In this challenge you will write actual code for a small web application that will collect information using an online form.  The web application should collect the name and address of a company and store it into a database. The web application will need information about the company, as well as company employees. 

There can be multiple employees per company. 
The application will need a way to show all companies and the number of employees per company in a table. 
Likewise the application will need to show each employee and their respective companies.
Please use proper validation and data filtering when collecting information using the online form. 
Write the SQL queries to create the database that will store this data.
